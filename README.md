# Automatic Generation of Type-and-Rule-Annotated qtree Trees with Python

The script is a very simple program that parses LaTeX [TikZ qtree](https://ctan.org/pkg/tikz-qtree?lang=en)<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> strings and outputs the same tree annotated with semantic types and the rules of composition (Heim-&-Kratzer-style) that led to that type. Being simple, the script comes with a number of restrictions some of which I'll detail below.

As an aside, my implementation is the offspring of a desire to program, rather than one to innovate. There are certainly better and more thought-out alternatives around.

## Getting Started

```python
# lexicon that includes the semantic types
lex = {"e": ["Andrew", "Mathis"], "<e, t>": ["hits"]}

# define the tree that is to be annotated
tree_string = "[.\\node(top){S}; [.NP^1 [.N^1 Andrew ] ] [.VP [.V hits ] [.NP^2 [.N^2 Mathis ] ] ] ]"

# save the output to a LaTeX file
with open("LaTeX/treeparses.tex", "w") as f:
    f.write(tree_to_latex(tree_string, lex))
```

## Flourishes

Next to annotating semantic types and rules of compositions, there are a few extra bits and pieces the script does (all of which can be disabled).

- optionally only annotate the logical type
- change the color of the type and rule annotations
- note the necessary number of iterations through the entire tree to arrive at a full representation for each node in the LaTeX document
- note the time it took
- composition errors can be colorized differently from the others. That is to say that composition errors (e.g. where a two nodes of type `e` are sisters) will not cause the script to crash (or complain). Instead, the rules and types of these nodes can be marked with "?" and colored in red.

## Examples

### Single Image

The input string in (1) produces the output below (once the corresponding (Xe)LaTeX code is compiled to pdf). Note that LaTeX functions need to be escaped (`\\node` instead of the LaTeX-native `\node`). The top node specification can be left out completely, however.

1. `[.\\node(top){S}; [.NP^1 [.N^1 Andrew ] ] [.VP [.V hits ] [.NP^2 [.N^2 Mathis ] ] ] ]`

## Restrictions

- Numerical subscripts on nodes are deleted automatically, as are all superscripts. This is done to enable lexical lookup and to handle potentially non-unique node labels.
- Lexical entries and the nodes corresponding to them must match exactly: the look-up is case sensitive (though there will be a warning if a lower-case or capitalized version of an input node exists) and does not recognize inflectional suffixes or the like (rectifying this would probably involve tokenizing, which is not in the scope of this project).
- ambiguous lexical entries need to be individuated via non-numerical subscripts (e.g. `that_{RP}` and `that_{dem}`). While I want to handle lexical ambiguity in a more elegant way in the future, subscripting is the only option for now.
